Google Maps Places 


This example demonstrates both Appcompat v7 SearchView & AutoCompleteTextView widget to preview a list of suggestions based on user queries.
On every user input Volley makes a request to Google Maps API and then parses the JSOn result to display place name.
Based on address entered by user, lat & long can be retrieved.
